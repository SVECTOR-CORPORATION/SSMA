# SSMA Architecture

The Structured State Matrix Architecture (SSMA) is designed to overcome the quadratic complexity of Transformers by:
- Using **Sparse State Transitions** to update a fixed-size state matrix.
- Implementing **Low-Rank Factorized Interactions** for efficient token mixing.
- Maintaining a **Hierarchical Memory** using a Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU).
- Enabling **Quantization-Aware Training** for hardware efficiency.

For the mathematical details and proofs, please refer to the full technical paper in the [SSMA.pdf](../SSMA.pdf).
